    {\large \bigskip \bigskip

    Logarithmic spirals are a family of self-similar spiral curves that are characterized by their radius growing in geometric progression as they rotate.

    Albrecht Dürer described the logarithmic spirals in 1525, but it was Jacob Bernoulli who called them \textbf{Spira Mirabilis}, \emph{«marvelous spirals»}, in 1692, because he was fascinated by their unique mathematical properties.

    In this document, we use the notation \emph{«$\lambda \, / \, \alpha$ spiral»} to refer to the particular logarithmic spiral whose radius gets multiplied by $\lambda$ after rotating an angle $\alpha$.

    For example, the radius of the \emph{«$2 \, / \, 90^{\circ}$ spiral»} gets multiplied by $2$ every $90^{\circ}$, which means that it will be 16 times longer after a full turn.

    Below you can find some usage examples for these curves and a curated set of printable templates that are free to use for educational purposes.
